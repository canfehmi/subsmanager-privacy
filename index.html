  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Subs Manager</strong> respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data.
    This application is designed to work primarily with locally stored data and does not require user accounts.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <p>
    Subs Manager does not require account creation and does not collect personal identification information.
    All subscription data entered by users is stored locally on the device.
  </p>

  <p>The app may store the following information locally:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Subscription names, prices, and billing cycles</li>
    <li>Categories and notes entered by the user</li>
    <li>User preferences such as language and appearance</li>
    <li>Premium purchase status</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or contact information.
  </p>

  <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>

  <p>
    Payments and subscriptions are processed securely by Google Play.
    Subs Manager uses RevenueCat to manage purchase verification and entitlements.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not store, access, or process payment details such as credit card numbers or billing information.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>

  <p>
    All locally stored data is used only to provide core app functionality, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Managing and displaying subscriptions</li>
    <li>Providing premium features</li>
    <li>Restoring purchases</li>
    <li>Improving app usability and stability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Limited data may be shared only with the following services for essential functionality:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Google Play Services (for billing and purchases)</li>
    <li>RevenueCat (for subscription management)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This data is used strictly for purchase verification and entitlement management.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

  <p>
    User data is stored locally on the device using secure storage mechanisms.
    We take reasonable measures to protect stored data.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, no electronic storage method is completely secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
  </p>

  <h2>User Data Control and Deletion</h2>

  <p>
    Users have full control over their data.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>All data can be deleted at any time using the "Clear All Data" option in the app settings.</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the application will also remove all locally stored data.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Since no cloud storage is used, deleted data cannot be recovered.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    Subs Manager is not intended for children under the age of 13.
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
    Any changes will be published on this page.
